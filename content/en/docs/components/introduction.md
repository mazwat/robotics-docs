You can use the **components** section to explore a range of parts from microcontrollers, shields, motors, servos and a whole range of other components that could be useful in a project that uses electronics or robotics.

We intended this site to function as a reference point when you are thinking about how to achieve something but you are unsure or when you want to find something to perform a specific task, you're not sure exactly what you might need.


**Note:** *The components listed here are not all available to buy in the lab. This is primarily a directory to make it easier for you to locate the part to buy elsewhere. Items that can be used or bought from the lab have this icon* âœ… *next to them.*
